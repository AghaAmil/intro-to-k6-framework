## Introduction to Performance Testing with K6

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama, with the goal of ensuring every American could access health care. A key part of this initiative was the creation of [HealthCare.gov](http://healthcare.gov/), a website designed to allow Americans to choose a healthcare plan.

However, when the website launched in 2013, it encountered serious issues. On the first day, 250,000 people attempted to sign up—five times the anticipated amount. But instead of success, only six people were able to register by the end of the day. The root cause? A failure in the website’s login feature, which could only handle a limited number of users simultaneously.

This real-world scenario demonstrates the critical importance of performance testing. By running performance tests, we can assess a system’s limits and avoid such catastrophic failures. This course is designed to help you understand and implement performance testing effectively.

## What is Performance Testing?

Performance testing is the process of simulating a high number of users to see if your application can handle the load. It's essential for ensuring that your system remains stable under stress.

Tools like JMeter, Gatling, and Locust are commonly used for performance testing, but they come with a steep learning curve. This is where K6 stands out—it’s a newer, easier-to-learn alternative, although it does require some coding. While K6 doesn’t have a user interface, it operates through a command-line interface (CLI) and is both free and open-source.

K6 uses JavaScript, a user-friendly programming language. You won’t need to dive deep into advanced coding to get started with K6. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife—simple yet powerful, with plenty of features you can pick up as you go.

## Course Structure

Here’s what you can expect from this course:

1. **Getting Started with K6**

    We’ll begin with the basics, including installation and setting up your first test. This will be your introduction to K6, much like learning to ride a bike—once you find your balance, everything else becomes easier.

2. **Understanding Performance Testing**

    Next, we’ll dive into the theory behind performance testing. You’ll learn key terms and different types of tests you can execute using K6, enabling you to understand when and how to use the tool effectively.

3. **JavaScript Crash Course**

    If you’re new to JavaScript, don’t worry. We’ll cover the essential concepts you need to know to work with K6, ensuring you understand the code you’re writing.

4. **Advanced K6 Features**

    Once you’re comfortable with the basics, we’ll move on to more complex scenarios. You’ll learn how to validate responses, write assertions, use thresholds, and more. We’ll also explore the K6 CLI and what Grafana Cloud K6 has to offer.

5. **CI/CD Integration**

    Finally, we’ll discuss how to integrate K6 into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) systems like Jenkins, GitLab, and CircleCI.


By the end of this course, you’ll have a solid understanding of performance testing with K6 and the ability to ensure your applications perform under pressure. Ready to get started? Let’s embark on this K6 adventure together!
