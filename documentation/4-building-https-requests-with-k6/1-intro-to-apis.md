If you're new to APIs, here's a quick introduction:

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**, with the key term being **interface**. To understand the
concept of an interface, imagine charging your phone. In the past, each phone manufacturer used its own connector type,
making chargers incompatible with other devices. Now, most devices utilize a universal standard called **USB-C**,
allowing one charger to power phones, tablets, and even game controllers.

## What is an Interface?

An **interface** acts as a contract, establishing a set of rules that ensures different parties can work together. For
USB-C, the specifications define the connectorâ€™s size, shape, pin count, and various other technical details. These
specifications ensure interoperability between devices and chargers. Without such a defined interface, you wouldn't be
able to charge your phone.

## What is an API?

An API is essentially an interface that allows access to data stored on a remote server, typically housed within a
database. This interface enables programs to communicate and exchange data with the server. Without an API, the server
would remain inaccessible to external programs.

## Web APIs

When discussing APIs, we usually refer to **web APIs**, which operate over the internet. APIs are everywhere. For
instance, any weather app on your phone communicates with an API to retrieve the latest weather forecasts. While there
may be only a few APIs that provide weather data, thousands of apps can access them via these APIs.

## API Usage

To summarize, an **API** is an interface to remote data stored on a server. However, unlike a user-friendly website or
mobile app, APIs are designed for programmatic use. Accessing an API requires writing code or executing commands in the
terminal.

## Introducing Postman

This is where **Postman** becomes invaluable. Postman allows you to connect to a server through an API and exchange data
without needing to write code or use the terminal. Postman provides a user-friendly interface, simplifying interaction
with APIs by handling much of the complex backend work for you.
