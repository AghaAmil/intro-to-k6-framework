When working with load testing tools such as k6, several key testing methodologies come to mind, including:

- **Performance Testing**
- **Load Testing**
- **Stress Testing**
- **Spike Testing**

Although these testing types share similarities, each serves a unique purpose and provides distinct outcomes. It is important to clearly define the objectives of your tests before diving into test writing and execution.

## Objective of this Section

The purpose of this section is to introduce the various types of tests that can be performed using k6. We will explore their objectives and learn how to configure and run these tests in k6. By the end of this section, you should have a foundational understanding of:

- The differences between each type of test.
- How to use k6 to implement them effectively.
